## üê± Overview

The purpose of this challenge is simple, create a new pokedex but now... a real mobile one ! You CAN use any ui.x libraries you want [ if interested, you can even create your own ]

## üê® Story

Hi, Pok√©dex?

Well, first just bootstrap a react-native application using expo that list all pokemons availables on [this](https://pokeapi.co/) Pok√©Api.

Basic pok√©mon view

We want to view a specific Pokemon detail ; For that you must add a kind of navigation to your application :)

## Trainer

As a trainer I want to choose specific pokemon to my wishlist ; For that you must add 2 things:

User authentication through Firebase
Allow to add or remove pokemon to a Wishlist view (through a touch action on a star button present near the pokemon in both list and details view)

## ü¶Ñ Bonus

I know you love that, well you can in bulk:

Add some animations
Add some localstorage useful features
Add a touch of geolocalisation
